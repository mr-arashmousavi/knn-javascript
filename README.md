# KNN Ball Drop Simulation

This project is a simulation using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) to analyze and predict outcomes of balls dropping into different buckets based on features like drop position, bounciness, and size. The simulation uses Matter.js for physics, Lodash for utility functions, and Semantic UI for styling.


## Features

1. **Ball Drop Simulation**: Drop balls with varying size and bounciness into buckets to collect data.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use k-NN to analyze collected data and predict outcomes based on different features.

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

## Usage
1. **Drop Balls**:
   - Drop a bunch of balls at various spots by setting the quantity and spacing, then click "Drop!".
   - Drop a bunch of balls at a single spot by setting the quantity and location, then click "Drop!".
2. **Analyze Data**: Click "Analyze!" to run the k-NN analysis on the collected data.
